I used the penguins.csv dataset in the following analysis
The name of the data analysis script is penguin_script.R
It performs 3 data analyses:
1. calculating the summary statistics of the penguins table
2. plotting a box plot of the body_mass_g variable
3. plotting a histogram of the bill_length_mm variable

I then saved the boxplot as penguins_boxplot.png histogram as penguins_hist.png

You can reproduce these analyses by first downloading the penguins.csv and saving it as a data table in R (penguins_df). Next, you'll want to call the variables from this data table within the analysis functions. For the summary you can use the summary function on the data table. Save this in a variable (summary). For the box plot, you can run the boxplot function on the bosy_mass_g variable. Save this in a variable (boxplot). For the histogram you can run the hist function and save the outcome in a variable (hist).
